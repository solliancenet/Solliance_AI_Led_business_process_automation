### Dialog 1

**Patient:** Hello Doctor, I have had a cough for the last few days, which becomes worse during the night. No fever but I feel tired. I haven't traveled anywhere and I've had no contact with anybody with Covid-19. It has been four to five days, and have drunk a lot of Benadryl and took Paracetamol too. Doctors have closed the emergency room, so I do not know what to do? Please help.  
**Doctor:** Hello, I understand your concern. I just have a few more questions. Does your cough have phlegm? Any other symptoms like difficulty breathing? Any other medical conditions such as asthma or hypertension? Are you a smoker? Alcoholic beverage drinker?  
**Patient:** I have phlegm but not a lot. I have no difficulty in breathing. No medical conditions and I am not a smoker nor a drinker.  
**Doctor:** I would recommend you take n-acetylcysteine 200 mg powder dissolved in water three times a day. You may also nebulize using a saline nebulizer three times a day. This will help the phlegm to come out. I would also recommend you take 500 mg of vitamin C and zinc to boost your immune system. If symptoms persist, worsen, or you start experiencing new onset of symptoms; then reach out to me again.

### Dialog 2

**Patient:** Hello Doctor, I am suffering from a cough, as well as a throat infection that started last week. At that time, the fever did not persist, and I also did not felt any chest pain. Two days later, I saw a doctor and he prescribed Cavidur 625, Montek LC, Ambrolite syrup, and Betaline gargle solution. Since then, the throat infection and cough have improved. My cough, is better but not gone. Since yesterday, I've had a fever of 100-degrees Celcius. I have not come in contact with anyone, and haven't left my house. In our state, there hasn't been anyone diagnosed with Covid-19 yet. What should I do?
**Doctor:** I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should a chest x-ray and CBC (complete blood count). If both these are normal, then there is no need to do any further testing. I hope this helps.  
**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor.

### Dialog 3

**Patient:** Hi, I am Roger, and I'm 27 years old. I like to swim every morning. Does COVID-19 spread through water? What precautions should I take to avoid infection?  
**Doctor:** Human to human spread of COVID-19 is mainly from air droplets. Therefore, I would suggest you refrain from swimming for now, even though the virus will get killed in the swimming pool if it does not find a host after a few minutes. Other precautions include avoiding social gatherings, washing hands frequently with soap and water, covering your mouth and nose with a mask, staying home when ill, and avoiding travel. I hope this helps. Let me know if I can assist you further.  
**Patient**: Thanks Doctor.

### Dialog 4

**Patient:** How do you get tested for Covid-19?
**Doctor:** That all depends on the severity. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, your doctor may request a video appointment instead of an in-person visit. Flu-like symptoms can be from multiple illnesses such as a strep throat infection, a cold or influenza, or from some other cause like COVID-19. Usually, a person calls the Doctor if the symptoms become severe and persistent. COVID-19 testing depends on local availability.  
**Patient:** Thanks Doctor.

### Dialog 5

**Patient:** My 11-year-old has a cough, a runny nose, and an earache. He doesn't have a fever. Is this COVID-19?  
**Doctor:** The symptom pattern is not specific to one illness. These symptoms could mean a cold and an ear infection. Kids have been among those least affected by Covid-19. Only proper screening and testing could confirm or exclude this or any other illness.
**Patient**: Thanks Doctor.

### Dialog 6

**Patient:** I traveled to Italy on 9 Jan 2020 and returned on 21 Jan 2020. My trip included a stopover in Amsterdam. I currently do not show any symptoms listed for coronavirus. Should I get lab-tested as a precaution, and will this test be covered by medical?  
**Doctor:** These questions are more appropriate to ask your local physicians and your health plan company. As a USA-based site, we have no access to local recommendations for world travel around the globe, nor would we know what your plan covers. Please reach out to your local physician for guidance.  
**Patient**: Thank you, Doctor.
